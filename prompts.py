Here is an example:
"[verse]\nWoke up in a city that's always alive\nNeon lights they shimmer they thrive\nElectric pulses beat they drive\nMy heart races just to survive\n\n[chorus]\nOh electric dreams they keep me high\nThrough the wires I soar and fly\nMidnight rhythms in the sky\nElectric dreams together we’ll defy\n\n[verse]\nLost in the labyrinth of screens\nVirtual love or so it seems\nIn the night the city gleams\nDigital faces haunted by memes\n\n[chorus]\nOh electric dreams they keep me high\nThrough the wires I soar and fly\nMidnight rhythms in the sky\nElectric dreams together we’ll defy\n\n[bridge]\nSilent whispers in my ear\nPixelated love serene and clear\nThrough the chaos find you near\nIn electric dreams no fear\n\n[verse]\nBound by circuits intertwined\nLove like ours is hard to find\nIn this world we’re truly blind\nBut electric dreams free the mind"
